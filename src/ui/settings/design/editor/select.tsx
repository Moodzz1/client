// Here we select a theme or allow the user to create a new theme
// If the user chooses to create a new theme, push create.tsx
//
// This page should send a flux event that closes the settings page
// and takes you to the main page of discord (where channels and stuff are)
// then opens the theme editor view
//
// NOTE: You can use the themes Addons page for this, just modify its appearance,
// its props allow for this, due to the sources page using an onPress
